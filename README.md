# Hi I'm Joanna 👋
## I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer 👩🏻‍💻

## About Me 💁🏻‍♀️
My path into the world of Web Development wasn't paved by a traditional academic route, but rather by a burning curiosity and the desire to create meaningful online interactions. Proficient in both Front-End and Back-End development, employing a tech stack encompassing JavaScript/React and Python/Django, my heart beats slightly faster for front-end magic. I find joy in translating ideas into visually captivating and user-friendly interfaces!
Currently seeking a junior position where I can contribute my skills and grow, I'm excited about the prospect of crafting something extraordinary together!
